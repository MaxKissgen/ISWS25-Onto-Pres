Initial Competency Questions (CQs):
**1.Content Organization & Narrative Flow**
1. Which standard presentation sections (e.g. Introduction, Background, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion) should be included for a given scientific topic?
2. What is the recommended order of the presentation sections to maximize logical coherence?
3. Which content items (e.g. technical details, background literature) should be simplified or omitted when presenting to an audience?
4. Which narrative devices (e.g. analogies, rhetorical questions, real-world examples) are applicable to enhance coherence across multiple sections?
5. Which scientific details are the most relevant based on presentation purpose and audience characteristics?
**2.Scientific Rigor & Accuracy**
1. How should statistical significance and uncertainty be communicated visually and verbally?
2.  Which statements or figures require citation metadata, and what citation style or format applies?
3. What level of methodological detail is necessary for reproducibility in a conference talk?
**3.Audience Awareness & Engagement**
1. How should technical depth be adjusted for interdisciplinary versus specialized conference audiences?
2. Which interactive or rhetorical techniques (e.g. live polls, thought experiments) are recommended for a given audience profile?
3. Which slide transition or timing strategies (e.g. slide duration, frequency of questions) help maintain audience attention?
**4. Delivery Performance & Presentation Skills**
1. Which body-language signals (e.g. open posture, gesturing) correlate with demonstration of confidence?
2. How should eye contact be distributed over audience zones relative to slide changes?
3. What verbal and non-verbal communication techniques enhance scientific credibility?
4. What are effective strategies for managing presentation anxiety while maintaining authority?
**5. Q&A Preparation and Management**
1. What structured templates (e.g. “Restate → Answer → Elaborate”) should be used to frame responses to audience questions?
2. Which strategies (e.g. bridging, deferring, clarifying) are appropriate for managing unexpected or critical questions?
